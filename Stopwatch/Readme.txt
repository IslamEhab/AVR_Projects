Simple project that implements a stopwatch using 6 x seven segments multiplixed together 
to use only 10 pins, 4 for decoder and 6 for NPN transistors to enable multiplixing algorithm.
There is a delay of 5 milli seconds between every seven segment unit to make the human feels like
all seven segments works together.
